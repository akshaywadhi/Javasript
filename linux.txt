=>TO REMOVE PASSWORD ASKING IN TERMINAL WHENEVER WE USE SUDO COMMAND:

Grant passwordless sudo access to your user.: This option is more secure than using the sudo -n option, as it only allows you to run commands with sudo privileges. To grant passwordless sudo access to your user, you need to edit the sudoers file.
To edit the sudoers file, open it in a text editor with root privileges. For example, to open the sudoers file in nano, you would type sudo nano /etc/sudoers.
Once you have opened the sudoers file, add the following line to the end of the file:
<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
Use code with caution.

=>Move Chrome Cache Location
The symlink command generally looks like this…

ln -s [new-location] [old-location]
Copy
This has been tested on xubuntu and ubuntu.

Make sure to close chrome browser.
Create a hidden folder in your new location called “.google-chrome”
Delete the old chrome location usually found at “/home/USERNAME/.cache/google-chrome”. You can use the following command for this.
rm -rf ~/.cache/google-chrome
Copy
Now re-create the old chrome location you deleted as a symlink to the new location with this command.
ln -s /new/location/path/.google-chrome ~/.cache/google-chrome
Copy
After opening chrome, if you’d like to check, open your file manager and go to “/home/USERNAME/.cache/google-chrome”. Right click on the folder and select “Properties”. You should see that for “Volume” it should show the new cache location.

That is all. You have now moved the chrome cache location in linux and don’t need to worry about it anymore.
