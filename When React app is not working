To upgrade Node you may first want to see which version of Node.js you are currently using:

node --version
Find out which versions of Node.js you may have installed and which one of those you're currently using:

nvm ls
List all versions of Node.js available for installation:

nvm ls-remote
Apparently for Windows the command would be rather like this:

nvm ls available
Assuming you would pick Node.js v8.1.0 for installation you'd type the following to install that version:

nvm install 8.1.0
You are then free to choose between installed versions of Node.js. So if you would need to use an older version like v4.2.0 you would set it as the active version like this:

nvm use 4.2
That should be all.
